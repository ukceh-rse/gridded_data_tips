Check jupyter is installed on your linux machine by typing 'which jupyter'.
If it says 'no jupyter found in ...' then you don't.
You can install it using anaconda, instructions are also provided in this folder.

Once this is done, copy this folder to your own home directory, so that people
don't try and edit it at the same time.

Then cd into the folder and type 'jupyter notebook Python_examples.ipynb'.
The notebook will then open in a browser window.
